# HTML Advanced - Semantic Webpage

## Project Overview
In this project, we will create a semantic HTML structure based on a designer file provided in Figma. The primary goal is to understand and implement proper HTML semantics without adding any styling or CSS.

## Objectives
- Replicate the webpage structure based on the Figma design.
- Use semantic HTML5 tags to organize content.
- Ensure the structure adheres to web standards and accessibility guidelines.

## Figma Resources
- [View the Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Source Sans Pro Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT Font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/spin-cycle-ot)
